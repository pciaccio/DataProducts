## Developing Data Products Final Project

The final project was to create a shiny app and deploy it on RStudio servers.  After that, prepare a pitch presentation about the app in Slidify or RStudio Presenter.

## Weight Loss App

My app was designed to calculate your progress through your weight loss goals.

The first step is to input your goal weight.  Then your starting weight and the date you started on your diet.  After that you can add days with different weights to see how far you have come from your start and how close you are to your goal.
